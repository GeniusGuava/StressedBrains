  `Ariadne: \n I'm bored. Where are the knights that are going to get me out of here? \nMaybe I can escape this labyrinth by myself. \nGod of VIM, please give me power! \nLooks like I can use 'h', 'j', 'k', & 'l' to walk around. I need to find keys to unlock the door.`,
  `Ariadne: \n Wow, this is not easy. I need to move faster so the enemy cannot catch me. \nI can sense that they are chasing me. God of VIM, please give me power to run faster! \nLooks like I can use 'w' to jump to the beginning of of the next word. Let's use that for battle.`,
  `Ariadne: \n The enemy is evolving. I need to learn some tricks to get rid of them quickly. \nGod of VIM, please give me power to scape enemy faster! \n\nLooks like I can use 'b' to jump backward to the beginning of the previous word.`,
  `Ariadne: \n Enemies are gathering. What should I do? Should I give up? \n No, I cannot back down just because they are bigger and stronger. God of VIM, please give me power! \nLooks like I can use 'e' now to jump to the end of the word. Keep Going!`,
  `Ariadne: \n I can see the outside now! One more gate, then I shall be free from this maze! \nNo one can stop me, I should be one in charge of my own destiny! God of VIM, please give me power. \nLooks like I can use all capital 'W/B/E' to move freely and ignore the punctuation!`,
